# darkmode-switch-app

This is a Mac app for macOS Mojave & above that toggles [Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/210/) on and off. 

It's based on the Automator code that [Thomas Verschoren](https://github.com/verschoren) provides in [this blog post](https://verschoren.com/2018/06/easily-toggle-between-light-and-dark-mode-in-macos-mojave/). I find it easier to toggle this using Spotlight to quickly open the single-purpose app, but his post explains how to add a Touch Bar button that does the same thing.
